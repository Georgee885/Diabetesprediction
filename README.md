# Diabetesprediction
This project aims to determine whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning techniques based on various health indicators.
Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure, we apply machine learning techniques to classify whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic.

The project follows a standard data science pipeline:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distributions and relationships.

Model building: Training and evaluating multiple classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting.

Performance evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

The final model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment, potentially reducing the burden of undetected diabetes through timely intervention.
